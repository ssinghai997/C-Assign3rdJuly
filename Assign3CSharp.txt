"Objectives: To understand   arrays in C#.

Problem description:
Create one console application ConsoleAnimal
Declare an array MyArray of size 5 in MAIN method, which will take five names of animal.
i.e. 
{"Zebra","Ant","Owl","Lion"}

Write a program  to print the above MyArray in the sequence given above by using following 
Loops.
i)	For loop.
ii)	Foreach loop.
iii)	Do While loop.
iv)	While loop.

Also display the same array list in sorted order i.e. alphabetically.

Declare two more string arrays  “animals” and “places” which will take following  entries
 {"Zebra","Kiwi","Amazona Parrot","Tiger"}
 
{"Africa","New Zealand","Jamaica","India"} 

Respectively. Display them one by one after sorting them by order using foreach loop.

ASSIGNMENT 2
Objectives:

1.	To understand Abstract Class
2.	To understand Interface 

Problem Description: 

1.	Create an interface IVolume which has following methods.
which contains read-only property which returns double as Volume
double Volume{get;}

2.	Create an interface IArea with method SurfaceArea() with returns double.

3.	Create an interface ISolid which inherits the above interfaces.

4.	Create an Abstract class  Class Solid which implements ISolid 
            Add two attributes as 
a.	radius               -----double
b.	pi   = 3.142       -----Constant double
            
            Create public readonly property of Volume as 
      public abstract double Volume
       {
         get;
       }
        
             Declare an Abstract Method of Interface in it.
             Create a Constructor of Class Solid.
             Create Public Properties for attributes;

5.	Create a Concrete Class Cylinder which derives from Class SOLID 
with Attributes double height  -
 
i.	Volume =  pi * Radius * Radius * height;
ii.	Surface Area = 2 * pi * Radius * (Radius + height)
    
        Override the Property Volume & pass the Formula to it which will return Volume.
        Show appropriate implementation method SurfaceArea ()
Create Appropriate Constructors for Class Cylinder

      
6.	Create a Class Sphere which inherits from class solid 

a.	Create a Constructor which will take parameters from base class.
b.	Override method which will return surface area using Formula
  (4 / 3) * pi * Radius * Radius * Radius;
c.	Override Property Volume which will calculate the Sphere 
 Using following formula
                         4 * pi * Radius * Radius;

7.	In Class Program
      
       Create a Static Method which will take ISolid object reference 
    As a input variable. Method will give output of Volume & Surface 
    Of Cylinder & Sphere. 
   
           In Main Method Create the Object of Cylinder Class & Sphere 
       Class and call the Show Method & show the output as Following 
  
                   
           
 



Assignment 3 
Objectives:
 
1.	To understand all string operations. 
 
Problem Description: 
 
1.	Create a console application which takes input as two strings. 
2.	Create a menu which has String Operations as menu Items as shown in given screen shot.
g `
3.	Perform all the operations mentioned on entered strings properly.
